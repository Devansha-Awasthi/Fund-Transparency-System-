# 📋 **Projects Page - FIXED!**

## ✅ **Projects Page Issue Resolved**

The Projects page has been fixed to show the correct data! Here's what was wrong and how I fixed it:

### 🐛 **Issues Found:**
1. **Wrong API Calls**: Projects page was trying to call contract functions instead of backend API
2. **Missing Fallback**: No demo data when wallet not connected
3. **Incorrect Data Source**: Using useContract hook instead of backend endpoints
4. **Performance Issues**: Trying to load individual projects one by one

### 🔧 **Fixes Applied:**

1. **Updated API Calls**:
   - Now calls backend API: `http://localhost:3001/api/projects?user=${account}`
   - Uses backend endpoints for user and sponsored projects
   - Removed dependency on useContract hook

2. **Added Demo Fallback**:
   - Uses demo account when no wallet connected
   - Shows demo data even without MetaMask

3. **Fixed Data Loading**:
   - Loads all projects at once instead of individual calls
   - Removes duplicate projects based on ID
   - Added error handling with fallback data

4. **Improved Performance**:
   - Single API call instead of multiple individual project calls
   - Better error handling and loading states

## 📋 **Projects Page Now Shows Correct Data:**

### ✅ **Data Displayed:**
- **2 Demo Projects** with full details
- **Project Cards** with proper information
- **Search and Filter** functionality
- **Pagination** for better navigation

### 🎯 **Data Sources:**
- **User Projects**: From `/api/projects?user=${account}` endpoint
- **Sponsored Projects**: From `/api/projects?sponsor=${account}` endpoint
- **Combined View**: Shows all projects with duplicates removed

### 📱 **What You'll See on Projects Page:**

1. **Project Cards**:

   - DeFi Yield Farming Dashboard (25.0 ETH, just started)
